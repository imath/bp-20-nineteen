# Contribute to the BP Legacy companion stylesheet for the Twenty Nineteen theme

BP Legacy is the Legacy Template Pack that BuddyPress introduced in version 1.7 of the plugin. In version 3.0, the Core Team introduced a "Nouveau" (_New_ in french) Template Pack and is now the default one when you activate the plugin.

Some of you might still use the BP Legacy Template pack and if you could help us to build its Twenty Nineteen [companion stylesheet](https://codex.buddypress.org/themes/buddypress-companion-stylesheets/), that would be awesome!

This child theme includes the patch the Core Team has been working on that is attached to the [#8103 ticket](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8103). You'll find the files of the patch into the `/css` directory of this child theme.

## How can you contribute?

- Test this child theme and give us your feedback commenting the [#8103 ticket](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8103)

- Just like any regular theme! See point 6 of the [WordPres user documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-themes/#adding-new-themes-using-the-administration-screens). You just need to make sure the parent theme "Twenty Nineteen" is available on your testing site (It should be the case as it comes with WordPress by default).
- [Activate](https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-themes/#activating-the-theme) it as the theme for your testing site.
- Make sure you activated the [latest version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress/) of the BuddyPress plugin (or the [development one](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk) if you're familiar with the process).
- From your WordPress dashboard, go to Settings > BuddyPress > Options and select `BP Legacy` as your Template Pack. See the screenshot below.
- Test and contribute!
